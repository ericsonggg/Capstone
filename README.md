# Capstone
## Architecture
MVVM

## Best Practices
1. Work on your individual branch
2. Ask for a code review for a pull request (PR) before merge
3. Auto-clean up code (ctrl + alt + shift + L) and optimize imports (ctrl + alt + o) on all files you change

## TODO (Unprioritized)
* Database (maybe [Room?] (https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room))
* More UI
* Bluetooth
* Online data backup
* Logging system in-between
